# Gilded Rose Kata

Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime
location in a prominent city run by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and
sell only the finest goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as
they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory
for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to
new adventures. 

Your task is to allow the code to accept new feature to our system so that we can begin
selling a new category of items.

First an introduction to our system:
* All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
* All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
* At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item

However, as usual, the original developers have left and there’s no reliable
document about the business rules. You’ll have to go with the code...

This is an adaption of the Gilded Rose kata, with "total" test coverage. It can be used to practice Object Calisthenics
Do you think it is possible to fully respect all 9 rules?
